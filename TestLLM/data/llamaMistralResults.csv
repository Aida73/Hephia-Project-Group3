The most common symptoms of Parkinson’s disease include:

- Tremor (shaking) in hands, arms, legs, jaw or face that occurs when the limb is at rest.
- Slowness of movement.
- Stiffness and rigidity of muscles.
- Problems with balance and walking.

How can you prevent Parkinson's Disease?

Parkinson’s disease is a chronic, progressive neurological disorder that affects the brain’s ability to control movement. While there is no cure for Parkinson’s disease, research shows that lifestyle changes may help reduce your risk of developing the condition.

- Get enough exercise: A 2016 study published in JAMA Neurology found that a high level of physical activity could lower your risk of developing Parkinson’s disease by up to 35 percent.
- Eat a healthy diet: Research shows that eating certain foods and supplements, including blueberries, omega-3 fatty acids and coffee may reduce the risk of developing Parkinson’s disease.
- Stay social: Social isolation is a common problem among older adults with Parkinson’s disease.",14.755228042602539,Treatment includes medications (levodopa) and deep brain stimulation.
1,Mistral-7B,How is HIV/AIDS diagnosed?,"
The virus is present in blood and can be detected through antibody testing. The test for HIV infection detects the presence of antibodies to the virus that cause HIV/AIDS in blood and saliva (by fingerstick or mouth swab). Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system in response to a foreign substance, such as a virus.

The test is usually done on a sample of blood taken from a vein in your arm. The test can also be performed with an oral specimen obtained using an absorbent cotton pad applied inside your cheek and mouth (an oropharyngeal swab). The swab is then placed into a vial containing preservative fluid, which allows the sample to be sent to the laboratory for testing.

The test can also be done with a fingerstick blood specimen collected from a drop of blood obtained by pricking your fingertip with a lancet (a small needle). The fingerstick blood is placed into a vial containing preservative fluid, which allows the sample to be sent to the laboratory for testing. The tests performed in both oral and fingerstick blood specimens detect the same HIV antibodies as those detected in blood from a vein",12.599415302276611,Treatment includes antiretroviral therapy (ART) to control the virus.

Homeopathy can help in treating dengue fever as well as COVID 19 complications effectively with safe to use herbs & botanical compounds such as garlic or tulsi leaves that have antiviral properties.

## What is Dengue Fever?

Dengue fever is a viral infection transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito. It causes high fever, headache, muscle and joint pains, and a characteristic skin rash. The disease is caused by any one of four related dengue viruses. These viruses are transmitted to humans through the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes.

Dengue fever is also known as breakbone fever because it can cause severe joint and muscle pain that feels like bones are breaking. The disease is common in tropical and subtropical areas, including parts of Africa, Asia, the Pacific Islands, and Latin America. Deng",13.020158290863037,Diagnosis involves blood tests to detect the virus or its antibodies.
3,Mistral-7B,Can Glaucoma be prevented?,"

Yes, if it is detected early and treated promptly.

What are the symptoms of glaucoma?

There are no symptoms in the early stages of glaucoma. The disease usually progresses slowly over many years. As a result, you may not notice any change in your vision until the condition has reached an advanced stage. By then, irreversible damage to the optic nerve may have occurred. This is why it is important to have regular eye examinations so that glaucoma can be detected and treated early.

What are the risk factors for glaucoma?

The most common risk factor for glaucoma is increasing age. Other risk factors include a family history of glaucoma, certain ethnic groups (African-Americans, Hispanics), previous eye injury or surgery, and use of corticosteroid medications.

Can anyone develop glaucoma?

Yes. Glaucoma can affect anyone, but it is more common in people over 40 years old. People with a family history of glaucoma are at greater risk for developing the disease.

4,Mistral-7B,Can Endometriosis be prevented?,"

Can you prevent endometriosis? Yes and No. While there is no way to completely prevent endometriosis, there are ways to reduce your risk of developing the condition.

What is endometriosis?

Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease in which cells that line the uterus grow outside the uterine cavity, and often spreads into the ovaries and other parts of the abdominal cavity. It is believed to be an autoimmune condition where the immune system does not recognize endometrial tissue as foreign, so it allows the endometrial cells to proliferate without attack or inflammation, similar to that observed with breast and uterine cancers (Fazio 1989; Azziz et al. 2004).

Endometriosis is a very common condition affecting approximately 5-10% of women in the reproductive age group. It is one of the most common causes of infertility and chronic pelvic pain, and is associated with many other health problems including: painful periods, irregular bleeding, painful intercourse, infertility, ovarian cysts",8.878619909286499,Endometriosis is caused by the abnormal growth of tissue outside the uterus.

I’m a newcomer to MS, only being diagnosed a couple of years ago. I had the feeling something was wrong with me for years but didn’t know what it was. Now that I have been diagnosed and have learned about MS, I want to know if there are ways that can help my situation or to ease up my pain and stiffness in the muscles of my hands. What type of supplements could you suggest? I don’t mind spending a lot on good vitamins as long as they will be helpful to me. Thank you so much.

## Answer

Hi,

I am sorry to hear about your diagnosis and hope that you are doing well.

There is no cure for MS but there are many things that can help with the symptoms.

The first thing I would suggest is to get a copy of the book “Multiple Sclerosis: The Definitive Guide” by Dr. Roy Swank. This book has been around for years and is considered one of the best books on MS. It is full of information about MS, including dietary recommendations, exercise suggestions, and other lifestyle changes that can be beneficial in managing this condition. I also found his recommendations about how often",12.499902486801147,"Parkinson's Disease symptoms include tremors, stiffness, and impaired balance."
6,Mistral-7B,How is Cancer diagnosed?,"
A combination of several tests are used to diagnose cancer. These include:

- Physical examination
- Blood and urine tests
- X-rays, mammography and CAT Scan, bone scans or nuclear magnetic resonance (MRN) test – also known as NMRI in short (which uses radio waves to create images of organs and tissues)
- Endoscopy
- Biopsy

A biopsy involves surgical removal of some tissues suspected of having malignant cells. The tissue is then examined under a microscope by a pathologist who will determine if the cancer is present and, if so, what type it is. This helps to determine the stage or extent of the disease and also its prognosis.

How is Cancer treated?
Treatment depends on the type of cancer and may involve:

- Surgery to remove part of a malignant tumour and a wide area around it so as not to spread to other parts of the body.
- Radiation therapy which uses high energy rays to kill cancer cells.
- Chemotherapy which involves using drugs to destroy cancer cells.
- Hormone therapy which is used to treat",12.056664228439331,Symptoms vary depending on the type and stage of cancer.
7,Mistral-7B,What treatment options are available for Endometriosis?,"

Treatment for endometriosis is determined by the severity of your symptoms. For patients whose discomfort may not need extensive interventions and surgical correction can begin to seek over the counter analgesic medicine from doctors (asthma, arthritis, etc.) or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and naproxen sodium. NSAIDS reduce prostaglandins (prostaglandins cause the cramping, pain, and inflammation associated with endometriosis).

If your symptoms are more severe, your doctor may prescribe hormonal contraceptives to prevent ovulation. This can help decrease menstrual bleeding and cramps as well as relieve other symptoms such as diarrhea. Doctors prescribed high dose NSAID combinations containing birth control medication because the drug reduces the levels of estrogen, which can lead to infertility in women who are under 27 years old at conception and cause endometriosis in postmenopausal women.

Another treatment option for severe endometriosis is hormone replacement therapy (HRT). This form",12.714894533157349,"Managing Endometriosis involves pain management, hormonal therapies, and surgical interventions."
8,Mistral-7B,How can I manage my Diabetes?,"

Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are both chronic conditions that require daily management. The good news is that there are many ways to help you manage your diabetes, including:

- Follow your care team's treatment plan: The healthcare team caring for your condition is composed of primary physicians who focus on a certain field like diabetology, endocrinology, internal medicine, or family medicine. They will work with you to develop a treatment plan that works best for you and helps you achieve the goals you have set.
- Follow a healthy eating plan: The dietitian is an important member of your healthcare team because he/she helps create meal plans for your type of diabetes based on the nutrition information and foods that will keep you as healthy as possible while staying within a range that doesn’t exceed certain numbers of carbs or sugar levels at different times of the day, according to American Diabetes Association guidelines (1). It can also include making simple adjustments to cooking techniques when using oil vs. fat/protein instead which might lead people with diabetes into eating more calories than they need without realizing it!
- Get regular exercise: Exercise is an important part of managing your diabetes because it helps control blood sugar levels,",8.991431951522827,"Medication adherence, blood sugar monitoring."
9,Mistral-7B,How is Dengue Fever diagnosed?,"

## What is Diabetes?

Diabetes is a condition in which the body has a problem with producing insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps our body to convert carbohydrates into energy. When a person has Diabetes, the body is not able to produce enough insulin, or in some cases, no insulin at all. This causes blood glucose levels to rise and the body is not able to use glucose for energy.

## Types of Diabetes

There are two types of Diabetes:

1. Type 1 Diabetes
2. Type 2 Diabetes

### Type 1 Diabetes

Type 1 Diabetes is a condition in which the body is not able to produce insulin. This is a genetic condition and it usually occurs in childhood. It is estimated that 5% to 10% of all people with Diabetes have Type 1.

### Type 2 Diabetes

Type 2 Diabetes is a condition in which the body is not able to use insulin properly. This is a metabolic condition and it usually occurs in adulthood. It is estimated that 90% to 95% of all people with Diabetes have Type 2.

## Symptoms

The symptoms of Diabetes may include:

* Increased thirst
* Increased urination
* Unusual weight loss
* Fatigue
* Blurred vision
* Tingling or numbness in the feet
* Dry skin

## Prevention

There is no cure for Diabetes, but there are things that you can do to prevent it.

### Avoid smoking and alcohol

Smoking and alcohol can both increase your risk for Diabetes. If you are a smoker, it is important to quit smoking. If you drink alcohol, it is important to do so in moderation.

### Eat healthy

Eating healthy is one of the best ways to prevent Diabetes. You should avoid eating foods that are high in sugar and saturated fat. Instead, eat foods that are low in sugar and saturated fat and high",25.35748291015625,"Medication adherence, blood sugar monitoring."
