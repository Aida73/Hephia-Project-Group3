1,How is HIV/AIDS diagnosed?,"HIV testing is done using blood samples. The most common test used to diagnose HIV infection is the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test, which detects antibodies to HIV in a blood sample. A positive ELISA result means that HIV antibodies were found in the blood sample and more testing is needed to confirm the diagnosis. If the ELISA test is positive, a Western blot test is usually performed to confirm the diagnosis. A Western blot test detects specific proteins made by HIV.     If you have been exposed to HIV through sex or sharing needles, getting tested right away can help determine whether you are infected. However, it takes time for your body to make enough antibodies for an accurate test result. If you get tested too soon, you may test negative even if you are infected. Health care providers recommend waiting at least 3 months after possible exposure before getting tested.    Stopping app - local entrypoint completed.",71.0,Mistral-Finetuned

6,How is Cancer diagnosed?,"Cancer is diagnosed with a biopsy. A biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a sample of cells or tissues     so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The type of biopsy performed         depends on the size and location of the tumor, as well as other factors.
        The following are some common types of biopsies:
        -  Fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. An FNA biopsy uses a thin needle to remove fluid and/or cells from a         lump or mass in the body. The fluid and/or cells are then examined under a microscope to look for cancer cells.         This type of biopsy is often used to diagnose thyroid cancer.  -  Core needle biopsy. A core needle biopsy uses a        larger needle to remove a small piece of tissue from a lump or mass in the body. The tissue is then examined under a             microscope to look for cancer cells. This type of biopsy is often used to diagnose breast cancer. - ional biopsy.                  An incisional biopsy removes part of a lump or suspicious area of tissue.The tissue is then examined under a microscope to look for cancer cells. This type of biopsy may be     used to diagnose skin cancer.  -  Excisional biopsy. An excisional biopsy removes an entire lump or area of tissue that doesnt look normal.         The tissue is then examined under a microscope to look for cancer cells. This type of biopsy may be used to diagnose melanoma.  -  Laparoscopy.             Laparoscopy is a surgical procedure that uses a thin tube called a laparoscope to look at the organs inside the abdomen to help find out if cancer                has spread there. Small instruments may be inserted through the same incision to take tissue samples. The tissue samples are then examined under                     a microscope to look for cancer cells. This type of biopsy may be used to diagnose ovarian cancer.  -  Thoracentesis. Thoracentesis is a procedure that uses a needle to remove fluid from the space between the lining of the chest and the lung. A pathologist views the fluid under a microscope to look for cancer cells. This type of biopsy may be used to diagnose mesothelioma.  -  Thorascopy. Thorascopy is a surgical procedure that uses a small camera on the end of a thin tube to look at the organs inside the chest to help find out if cancer has spread there. Small instruments may be inserted through the same incision to take tissue samples. The tissue samples are then examined under a microscope to look for cancer cells. This type of biopsy may be used to diagnose lung cancer.  -  Bronchoscopy. Bronchoscopy is a procedure that uses a thin, flexible tube to look inside the trachea and large airways in the lung. A bronchoscope may also have a light and a lens for viewing. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. This type of biopsy may be used to diagnose lung cancer.  -  Mediastinoscopy. Mediastinoscopy is a surgical procedure that uses a thin, tube-like instrument to look at the organs, tissues, and lymph nodes between the lungs for abnormal areas. A mediastinoscope may also have a light and a lens for viewing. Small instruments may be inserted through the same incision to take tissue samples. The tissue samples are then examined under a microscope to look for cancer cells. This type of biopsy may be used to diagnose lung cancer.  -  Colonoscopy. Colonoscopy is a procedure that uses a long, flexible, narrow tube with a light and a lens for viewing (colonoscope) to look inside the rectum and the colon for polyps or abnormal areas. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. This type of biopsy may be used to diagnose colorectal cancer.  -  Cystoscopy. Cystoscopy is a procedure that uses a long, thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing (cystoscope) to look inside the bladder and urethra for abnormal areas. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. This type of biopsy may be used to diagnose bladder cancer.  -  Prostate biopsy. A prostate biopsy is a procedure that uses needles to remove small pieces of tissue from the prostate. The tissue is
